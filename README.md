# Documentation to publish on central NOMAD when no core parsers handle your files

## Disclaimer
This documentation is written by a NOMAD user in no way involved in the development of the NOMAD tool.
What is presented here is based on many tries and failures using the official NOMAD [documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/) and the tutorials series on the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheNOMADLaboratory/playlists) of FAIRmat.
Therefore, the explanations might not reflect the reality of the software or the real ideas of the developers but they do reflect what I could achieve following the aforementioned documentation and tutorials.

## Organisation of the documentation
This repository explains how to publish scientific files on central NOMAD when there is no core parsers that recognise any of the uploaded files.
- The `Long documentation` will provide an explanation as complete as possible. Recommended to read the first time you are trying to upload data on central NOMAD if no parser recognises your files.
- The `Practical documentation` is a refresher in a case where you already read the complete documentation and forgot or if you already know what you are doing and look for visuals or examples to help you.
- The `Examples files` folder groups different files that one can upload on NOMAD to illustrate the explanations provided in the complete documentation and grasp the behaviour of NOMAD.
- The `YAML schemas` folder groups all the YAML schemas files used to publish files produced in AddMorePower.
